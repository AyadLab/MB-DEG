Overview
The code provided performs analysis of publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets (Darmanis 2017) and (Hovestadt 2013) and generates key figures related to the manuscript.
Overall, the analysis here compared neoplastic MB cells to non-tumor brain cells. This can be used in other contexts to perform differential expression analysis.
